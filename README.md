###### Brief Description and Snapshots - We put forth the ICC Meta League model, which has the potential to completely change the fintech industries. The user will first log in using the "Arcana" authenticated system, which will take him to the NFTs Market Place, where he can purchase players' NFTs. In order to create an equal user interaction with women's cricket, we decided to have a 2:1 man to woman NFT ratio and set the maximum number of NFTs at 3. We created the ICC Bet DEN platform, where users can bet on their NFTs during live matches that are currently taking place while also participating in leagues. Additionally, ICC Bet DEN offers ball-to-ball predictions, where the user with the most accurate wager wins league tokens. The token can be used in a variety of ways, including cashing out with NUIM payment services, purchasing goods from ICC, and collaborating with nearby partner stores across platforms. We created the ICCC, a chatroom platform where users can specify their geographic region and other users within that region can communicate and play league games. The user can use their token to exchange goods with registered shops near them that are visible on a map. The ICCC will be integrated with ICC TV so that groups of spectators can view and discuss live matches. The local coordinates and details of the people with whom the user can interact will be available in cross-platform interaction. The ICC Meta League's most intriguing move is to rent and lease players, which will control the flow of NFTs and improve the quality of the content.
